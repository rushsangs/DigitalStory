<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> An algorithm is proposed to generate a story world from a linear narrative. The goal is to extract the actors, affordances, relationships, and the states from the input story and store this our story world structure. Natural language processing is used on the input to produce a more meaningful story world. Once the story has been processed by our algorithm, a story generating algorithm is used to test the range of stories that can be made from our story world structure.  </p>

<p><strong>Weekly Development Progress:</strong> <br>(3/11/2016) - Initial structures defined <br>(3/18/2016) - User interface is designed and implemented<br>(3/25/2016) - Stories are now extracted and stored in our story world structure<br>( 4/1/2016) - Added a simple story generating algorithm and natural processing logic<br>(4/8/2016) - Updated the story world structure to define action post-conditions and added the functionality to accept text files as input. See comments for more info.<br>(4/16/2016) - Added in affordance sharing. A way of generalizing objects into classes.</p>

<p><strong>Research Skills:</strong> <br>In [SMITH and WITTEN 1991], a general structure was defined to hold all information on a story world. A connectivity relation called the cango rule was used as a way of enforcing causal links.The way our structure defines relationships between objects used a similar idea that was proposed.<br>In [Meehan 1977], a story generating program called Tale-Spin was designed. It generates a story using a problem solver, an assertion mechanism, and an inference mechanism. The problem solver finds the next state that brings you closer to the goal, the assertion mechanism saves each state in memory, and the inference mechanism generates the post condition from the event generated from the problem solver. The Tale-spin's problem solver concept will be used in our story generating algorithm. <br>In [Gervás et al. 2005] a story was generated from a set of inputs using code-based reasoning and then translated to natural text using a natural language generator. The idea to add natural language processing to our algorithm originated from here.<br>In [Reidl and Leon 2009], an existing story structure was extracted and applied to a new setting. The original problem we are trying to solve originated after reading this paper.<br>In [Gervás 2009], a brief introduction to story generating systems was told. Systems like Tale-Spin or Novel Writer were described and analyzed. These various story generating algorithms helped refine our story world structure by using similarities between them.</p>
